üëçFine tuning Atom:

* Use ctrl-shift-m to preview
* Go to Settings
* Go to Install
* Look for package 'autocomplete-emojis'
* Install if necessary
* From now emojis are supported with auto-complete (start typing : and one letter) and are visible in edit and preview mode.
* Used on this site: ‚ùåis called 'x' in that package so type ':' followed by 'x' (of course without the apostrophes), üëç 'thumbsup', ‚úîÔ∏è 'heavy_check_mark', ‚ùó 'heavy_exclamation_mark', ‚ö†Ô∏è 'warning'

üëçUsing Markdown on Github:

* You can not open a link in a new tab due to the rendering software of Github.
* This rendering engine also limits the use of colors.

üëçFine tuning Notepad++:

* Add the NppExport plugin. With this plugin it is possible to have a selected piece of formatted (colored) code exported to e.g. Word.

üëçFine tuning 3D Studio:
Sometimes using standard rail tracks gaps and misalignments appear in your design. Of version 6 there is a simple solution:

* In the example below we want to manipulate the track right on the bottom
* Click the track. A circle and a red and green arrow appear.
* Click on the blue arrow to pointing to the left. A yellow box appears.
* Drag the yellow square box to make the track bigger until it snaps the the other track.
* The gap is gone.
