👍Fine tuning Atom:

* Use ctrl-shift-m to preview
* Go to Settings
* Go to Install
* Look for package 'autocomplete-emojis'
* Install if necessary
* From now emojis are supported with auto-complete (start typing : and one letter) and are visible in edit and preview mode.
* Used on this site: ❌is called 'x' in that package so type ':' followed by 'x' (of course without the apostrophes), 👍 'thumbsup', ✔️ 'heavy_check_mark', ❗ 'heavy_exclamation_mark', ⚠️ 'warning'

👍Fine tuning Notepad++:

* Add the NppExport plugin. With this plugin it is possible to have a selected piece of formatted (colored) code exported to e.g. Word.
